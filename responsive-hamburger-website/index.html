        <h3> Howard Vogl</h3>

        <p> Welcome to my website. My name is Howard Vogl. I'm an Assistant Professor in the Graphic Communication Department at Cal Poly State University in San Luis Obispo California. This is my fifth year at Cal Poly and I've enjoyed every minute of my time here.</p>

        <h3>About me and what I'm thinking</h3>
	    
	    <p><em>Where do you go from here?</em></p>
        
	    <p>I believe that lifelong learning is the key to a happy life. Learning something new excites me. Not only is learning exciting, but also it’s the best way to find out about the world around you, and importantly, find out about yourself. <br><br> Students often ask me about the path they should take after graduating. To be honest, I don’t know. In fact no one knows, but here are two of my favorite quotes that may give you some perspective.</p><br>

        <blockquote>One should waste as little effort as possible on improving areas of low competence. It takes far more energy and work to improve from incompetence to mediocrity than it takes to improve from first-rate performance to excellence.</blockquote><p>—Peter F. Drucker</p><br>
    
        <blockquote>All paths are the same: they lead nowhere. There are paths going through the bush, or into the bush...Both paths lead nowhere; but one has a heart, the other doesn’t. One makes for a joyful journey; as long as you follow it, you are one with it. The other will make you curse your life. One will make you strong; the other weakens you.</blockquote><p>—Carlos Castaneda</p>
